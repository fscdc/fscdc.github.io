I am currently an undergraduate student in Nankai University, majoring in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in model compression (e.g., pruning, efficient LLMs) and reasoning with LLMs/MLLMs (efficiency, visual reasoning). I have worked with [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at the [ENCODE Lab](https://encode-lab-ai.github.io/), Westlake University, and with [Prof. Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/) at the [xML Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus), National University of Singapore. These experiences have shaped my research interests and allowed me to work closely with leading researchers in the field.
